Project-aware CI/CD validation for task: $ARGUMENTS

DYNAMIC CI/CD INTEGRATION:

Auto-detect and integrate with project's CI/CD infrastructure:

**Pipeline Detection & Integration:**

- Identify CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.)
- Parse configuration files for project-specific validation requirements
- Integrate with existing quality gates and deployment workflows
- Understand branch protection rules and merge requirements

**Comprehensive Quality Validation:**

**Code Quality & Standards:**

- All tests passing with project-specific test frameworks
- Linting and formatting validation using project's tools
- Type checking and static analysis (TypeScript, mypy, etc.)
- Code coverage thresholds met per project configuration
- Architectural compliance and design pattern validation

**Security & Compliance:**

- Security vulnerability scanning with project-specific tools
- Dependency vulnerability assessment and remediation
- SAST/DAST integration where configured
- License compliance validation
- Secrets scanning and prevention

**Performance & Reliability:**

- Performance benchmarks maintained or improved
- Load testing results within acceptable thresholds
- Memory and resource utilization validation
- Database migration safety and rollback testing
- API contract validation and backward compatibility

**Documentation & Knowledge:**

- Documentation updated and synchronized with implementation
- API documentation auto-generation and validation
- Code comments and technical documentation completeness
- Changelog and release notes preparation

**Integration & Deployment Readiness:**

- Integration tests passing across all environments
- Database migration validation in staging environment
- Feature flag configuration and rollout strategy validation
- Monitoring and alerting setup for new functionality
- Rollback procedure validation and testing

**Project-Specific Validations:**

**Frontend Applications:**

- Bundle size analysis and optimization validation
- Accessibility compliance testing (WCAG, a11y)
- Cross-browser compatibility validation
- Progressive Web App requirements (if applicable)
- Performance metrics (Core Web Vitals, Lighthouse scores)

**Backend Services:**

- API rate limiting and throttling validation
- Database performance and query optimization
- Service mesh integration and circuit breaker testing
- Logging and monitoring instrumentation validation
- Distributed tracing and observability setup

**Mobile Applications:**

- Platform-specific validation (iOS App Store, Google Play)
- Device compatibility and performance testing
- Offline functionality and data synchronization
- Push notification and deep linking validation

**DEPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENT VALIDATION:**

**Staging Environment:**

- Full integration testing with production-like data
- Performance testing under realistic load conditions
- User acceptance testing preparation and validation
- Feature flag configuration and testing

**Production Readiness:**

- Blue-green deployment strategy validation
- Canary release configuration and monitoring setup
- Incident response and rollback procedures tested
- Stakeholder approval and sign-off documentation

**CONTINUOUS MONITORING SETUP:**

- Application performance monitoring integration
- Business metrics and KPI tracking setup
- Error tracking and alerting configuration
- User experience monitoring and feedback collection

Generate comprehensive deployment readiness report with project-specific validation results and recommendations.
