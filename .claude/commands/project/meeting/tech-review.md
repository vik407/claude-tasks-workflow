Generate comprehensive technical review document for task: $ARGUMENTS

TECHNICAL REVIEW PURPOSE:
Create an in-depth technical presentation document for architecture reviews, code reviews, or detailed technical discussions. This document enables screen sharing with comprehensive technical context.

COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW STRUCTURE:

1. **Technical Executive Summary** 
   - Problem statement with business impact
   - Solution approach with architecture rationale
   - Implementation status and next steps
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

2. **Deep Technical Analysis**
   - Root cause investigation with evidence
   - System architecture impact analysis
   - Integration points and dependencies
   - Performance and scalability considerations

3. **Solution Architecture Deep Dive**
   - Design patterns applied and rationale
   - Tool-agnostic principles implementation
   - Alternative approaches considered and rejected
   - Future extensibility and maintenance considerations

4. **Implementation Walkthrough**
   - File-by-file change breakdown with rationale
   - Code examples and pseudo-code where helpful
   - Testing strategy with coverage details
   - Deployment and rollback procedures

5. **Screen Sharing Guide**
   - Specific files to open during presentation
   - Line-by-line walkthrough sequence
   - Before/after code comparisons
   - Configuration changes and their impact

CONTENT SYNTHESIS:
Aggregate and present information from:

- analysis.md - Root cause and investigation findings
- plan.md - Solution architecture and implementation strategy  
- implementation files - Progress and technical decisions
- validation.md - Testing results and quality metrics
- Any rejection or status change documentation
