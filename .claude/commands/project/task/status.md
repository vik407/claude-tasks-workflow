Generate context-aware comprehensive status for task: $ARGUMENTS

DYNAMIC STATUS ASSESSMENT:

1. **Current Phase** - Analysis/Planning/Implementation/Validation with context
2. **Completion Percentage** - Within current phase with project-specific metrics
3. **Active Blockers** - Technical, process, and dependency blockers
4. **Project Integration Status** - Alignment with codebase and team patterns
5. **Next Steps** - Immediate actions with project-specific guidance
6. **Timeline** - Estimated completion with resource and complexity considerations

CONTEXTUAL PHASE VALIDATION:

- Check existence and quality of required documentation files
- Verify phase gates completed with project-specific quality standards
- Validate integration with project's CI/CD and quality tools
- Assess alignment with team processes and communication patterns
- Flag any workflow violations or shortcuts taken
- Evaluate technical debt impact and architectural alignment

PROJECT-AWARE DELIVERABLES:

- **Current task state summary** with technology stack context
- **Documentation compliance report** against project standards
- **Technical integration status** with codebase health assessment
- **Risk and blocker identification** with project-specific mitigation strategies
- **Resource and timeline analysis** based on team capacity and complexity
- **Quality assurance status** using project's testing and validation tools

ADAPTIVE REPORTING:

- **For Technical Teams**: Include code quality metrics, test coverage, performance impact
- **For Product Teams**: Focus on feature progress, user impact, business value delivery
- **For Management**: Highlight resource utilization, risk factors, timeline adherence

REMEDIATION GUIDANCE:

If task is out of compliance with workflow:

- Provide specific remediation steps aligned with project practices
- Include sub-agent recommendations for getting back on track
- Suggest process improvements based on discovered blockers
- Recommend timeline adjustments based on actual complexity discovered

Auto-invoke meeting-facilitator sub-agent for stakeholder communication preparation.
