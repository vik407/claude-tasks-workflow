## 🎯 Claude 4 Optimization Features

### Explicit Instruction Framework

Every sub-agent and command now uses Claude 4 prompt engineering best practices:

```bash
# Before: Implicit instructions
"Analyze the task and provide recommendations"

# After: Explicit step-by-step processes
"Follow this exact sequence for comprehensive analysis:
1. Quote relevant sections from project context
2. Identify root cause with specific evidence
3. Assess system impact with component mapping
4. Provide 3 actionable recommendations with priorities
5. Structure response using XML format below"
```

### Structured XML Output

All workflow components now generate standardized, parseable responses:

```xml
<!-- Analysis Output Schema -->
<analysis>
<problem_statement>Clear issue description with evidence</problem_statement>
<root_cause>
  <evidence>Specific code/log references</evidence>
  <technical_details>Technical explanation</technical_details>
</root_cause>
<system_impact>
  <affected_components>List with file paths</affected_components>
  <integration_points>External dependencies</integration_points>
</system_impact>
<recommendations>
  <primary_recommendation priority="high">Most important action</primary_recommendation>
  <secondary_recommendation priority="medium">Supporting action</secondary_recommendation>
</recommendations>
</analysis>
```

### Enhanced Thinking Integration

Complex sub-agents now provide transparent reasoning:

```xml
<thinking>
Let me break down this task systematically:
1. What are the explicit requirements mentioned?
2. What technical context is provided?
3. What are the likely integration points?
4. What risks should I consider?
5. How does this align with the project's architecture patterns?
</thinking>

<!-- Structured analysis follows based on systematic reasoning -->
```

### Parallel Processing Optimization

Commands now execute operations concurrently for improved performance:

```bash
# Parallel operations automatically coordinated
- Context analysis + file structure detection
- Evidence collection + dependency mapping  
- Risk assessment + impact analysis
- Documentation generation + validation checks
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ 50% faster execution for multi-step operations

# → Creates cached .claude/project-context.md

# Subsequent tasks: Instant context reuse
/project:task:init ABC-1240 "add dashboard export feature"
# → References cached context, starts immediately

# Selective context refresh when needed
/project:context:refresh dependencies  # Only updates dependency analysis
```

**Performance Improvements:**

- ✅ 90% faster task initialization after first project analysis
- ✅ Selective context refresh (dependencies, architecture, patterns)
- ✅ Token usage optimization through intelligent caching

### Knowledge Management System

Accumulate and reuse project wisdom over time:

```bash
# Extract patterns from completed tasks
/project:knowledge:extract architectural-patterns

# Generate quarterly knowledge summary
/project:knowledge:summary Q3-2025

# Reference accumulated patterns for new tasks
@task-planner ABC-1241 "use existing authentication patterns from project knowledge"
```

**Knowledge Categories:**

- **Architectural Decisions**: Design choices with rationale
