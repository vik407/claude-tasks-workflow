# Changelog

All notable changes to the Claude Tasks Workflow system are documented here.

## Version 4.0 - Sonnet 4.5 Streamlined (October 2025)

### Revolutionary Streamlining

**Before (Version 3.0 - Claude 4 Optimized):**

- XML output schemas for structured data
- Explicit instruction frameworks
- Complex multi-level thinking blocks
- Parallel processing optimization

**After (Version 4.0 - Sonnet 4.5):**

- Clean markdown outputs (readable, human-friendly)
- Binary complexity classification (SIMPLE vs. COMPLEX)
- Shared agent guidelines (reduced redundancy)
- Native Sonnet 4.5 optimization (no manual parallelization needed)

### Key Changes

#### Streamlined Agent Design

- **Evidence-Based Approach**: Agents gather concrete evidence before drawing conclusions
- **Clean Markdown Output**: Readable, structured outputs instead of XML schemas
- **Binary Complexity**: Simplified from 3-tier to 2-tier (SIMPLE < 1 day, COMPLEX 1+ days)
- **Shared Guidelines**: Common principles in `.claude/shared/agent-guidelines.md` reduce redundancy

#### Native Tool Coordination

Sonnet 4.5 automatically optimizes parallel tool execution:

- Smart parallelization without explicit instruction
- Automatic dependency detection and sequencing
- No configuration required

#### Reduced Token Overhead

- 40-50% reduction in agent prompt size
- Faster response generation
- More efficient context usage
