## Usage Changes

### Meeting Commands (New Syntax)

**Before** (4 separate commands):

```bash
/project:meeting:all-briefings ABC-1234
/project:meeting:standup-brief ABC-1234
/project:meeting:tech-review ABC-1234
/project:meeting:code-walkthrough ABC-1234
```

**After** (1 parameterized command):

```bash
/project:meeting:brief standup ABC-1234
/project:meeting:brief tech-review ABC-1234
/project:meeting:brief code-walkthrough ABC-1234
/project:meeting:brief all ABC-1234
```

### All Other Commands

Paths unchanged, but internally:

- Use markdown output (not XML)
- Cleaner, more concise documentation
- No verbose validation explanations
- 50-60% token reduction

---

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Full Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# From project root
cp -r src/claude/* .claude/

# This deploys:
# - 5 streamlined agents
# - 1 shared guidelines file
# - 24 consolidated commands
# - All supporting files
```

### Option 2: Selective Deployment

```bash
# Just update agents
cp -r src/claude/agents/* .claude/agents/
cp src/claude/shared/agent-guidelines.md .claude/shared/

# Just update commands
cp -r src/claude/commands/* .claude/commands/

# Just update meeting commands
cp src/claude/commands/project/meeting/brief.md .claude/commands/project/meeting/
rm .claude/commands/project/meeting/{all-briefings,standup-brief,tech-review,code-walkthrough}.md
```

### Verification Steps

After deployment:

1. **Test Meeting Command**:

   ```bash
   /project:meeting:brief standup TEST-001
   ```

2. **Test Task Workflow**:

   ```bash
   /project:task:init TEST-002
   @task-analyzer TEST-002
   ```

3. **Verify Output Format**:
   - Confirm markdown structure (not XML)
   - Check readability
   - Validate agent invocations work

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback is straightforward:

### Git Rollback

```bash
# Rollback all changes
git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/claude/

# Rollback specific areas
git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/claude/agents/
git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/claude/commands/
```

### Selective Rollback

```bash
# Keep source changes, revert deployment
# Just don't copy to .claude/ yet
# No workflow disruption
```

### Zero Risk

- Source changes are in `src/claude/`
- Deployment is manual copy to `.claude/`
- Can test before deploying
- Can deploy incrementally

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate

1. ✅ **Review this summary**
2. ⏳ **Test with sample workflow** (recommended before production deployment)
3. ⏳ **Deploy to `.claude/`** when ready
4. ⏳ **Update team documentation** with new meeting command syntax

### Optional Future Enhancements

- Context command consolidation (~100-200 line savings)
- Workflow command review (potential 2-3 file reduction)
- Additional pattern refinements
