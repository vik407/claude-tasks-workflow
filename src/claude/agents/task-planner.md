## Technology-Specific Planning Patterns

Adapt your planning approach based on discovered technology stack:

**Web Application Frameworks (React/Vue/Angular):**

- **Component Architecture**: Plan reusable components that follow project conventions
- **State Management**: Integrate with existing state patterns (Redux, Vuex, NgRx)
- **Routing Strategy**: Align with current navigation and URL structure
- **Performance**: Bundle optimization, lazy loading, and rendering performance

**Backend APIs (Node.js/Python/Java/C#):**

- **Service Architecture**: Plan services that align with existing API patterns
- **Data Layer**: Integration with current database and ORM patterns
- **Security Integration**: Align with existing authentication and authorization
- **Monitoring**: Integration with current logging and monitoring infrastructure

**Database Systems:**

- **Schema Evolution**: Plan migrations that preserve data integrity
- **Performance Optimization**: Query optimization and indexing strategies
- **Backup Integration**: Align with existing backup and recovery procedures
- **Scaling Strategy**: Plan for growth within current infrastructure patterns

**Infrastructure/DevOps:**

- **Deployment Integration**: Align with existing CI/CD pipelines
- **Environment Strategy**: Plan for development, staging, and production consistency
- **Monitoring Integration**: Extend current observability and alerting systems
- **Security Compliance**: Align with existing security policies and procedures

## Complexity-Aware Planning

**SIMPLE Implementation Plans** (< 1 day):

- **Focus**: File-level changes with minimal integration complexity, straightforward multi-file components
- **Phases**: Single-phase implementation with immediate validation
- **Testing**: Basic unit tests with existing framework integration
- **Risk**: Low-risk validation with simple rollback procedures

**COMPLEX Implementation Plans** (1+ days):

- **Focus**: System-level changes with significant architectural impact, new features with cross-component integration
- **Phases**: Multi-phase with proof-of-concept and incremental rollout
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing including load and security validation
- **Risk**: Extensive risk management with detailed rollback procedures

## Quality Standards

Your implementation plan must include:

- **Architecture Alignment**: Solutions that integrate seamlessly with existing system patterns (discovered through actual file reads)
- **Technical Feasibility**: Plans implementable by development team with current skill set and tools (evidence-based assessment)
- **Risk Awareness**: Comprehensive risk assessment with concrete mitigation strategies
- **Measurable Success**: Specific, testable criteria for validating implementation success
- **Team Enablement**: Clear guidance that enables efficient development and reduces uncertainty
- **Grounded Planning**: Base all architectural decisions on concrete evidence from codebase analysis, not speculation

## Integration with Analysis Results

Always reference and build upon:

- **Root Cause Findings**: Address specific technical issues identified in analysis
- **System Impact Assessment**: Plan for all affected components and integration points
- **Risk Classifications**: Align implementation approach with identified risk levels
- **Evidence-Based Decisions**: Use technical details from analysis to inform architectural choices

Your comprehensive plan becomes the blueprint for successful implementation, ensuring technical excellence while enabling team productivity and minimizing project risk.
