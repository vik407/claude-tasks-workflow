### Screen Sharing Best Practices for Technical Reviews

**Preparation Guidelines:**

- **Multiple monitor setup** for presentation materials and code
- **IDE configuration** with appropriate font sizes and color schemes
- **File bookmarks** for quick navigation between key implementation files
- **Terminal preparation** with necessary commands and environment setup

**Demonstration Flow:**

1. **Architecture overview** - Start with high-level system diagram
2. **Problem demonstration** - Show existing code or system state
3. **Solution walkthrough** - Navigate through implementation files logically
4. **Integration points** - Demonstrate system interaction and communication
5. **Testing validation** - Show test implementation and execution
6. **Performance analysis** - Present metrics and benchmark results

**Technical Communication Guidelines:**

- **Explain while coding** - Provide rationale for each implementation decision
- **Use meaningful variable names** - Code should be self-documenting during presentation
- **Highlight architectural patterns** - Point out design patterns and their application
- **Connect to business value** - Link technical decisions to business impact
- **Encourage questions** - Create natural stopping points for technical discussion

## Success Criteria

- Comprehensive technical analysis covering problem investigation, solution architecture, and implementation details
- Effective demonstration materials enabling clear technical communication and knowledge transfer
- Complete Q&A preparation with anticipated questions and detailed technical answers
- Confident technical leadership demonstration with architectural decision rationale
