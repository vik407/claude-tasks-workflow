Create Phase 2 implementation plan for task: $ARGUMENTS

PREREQUISITES:

- Analysis phase must be complete
- Root cause must be documented
- Cannot proceed without approved analysis.md

PLANNING REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Solution Architecture** - Tool-agnostic approach
2. **File Change Mapping** - Exact files to modify/create
3. **Testing Strategy** - Unit, integration, E2E tests
4. **Rollback Plan** - How to undo changes safely
5. **Implementation Order** - Step-by-step execution

DELIVERABLES:

- Complete .claude/tasks/[TASK-ID]/plan.md
- File-by-file change documentation
- Test coverage strategy
- Risk mitigation plan

ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES:

- Solutions should survive framework changes
- Prefer composition over complex inheritance
- Design for future extensibility
- Document architectural decisions

PHASE GATE: Cannot implement until plan is validated and approved.
