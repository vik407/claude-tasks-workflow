Generate context-aware comprehensive status report for task: $ARGUMENTS

## Explicit Instructions

This command accomplishes the following specific objectives:

1. **Generate dynamic task status assessment** with real-time phase analysis and completion metrics
2. **Validate workflow compliance** against project standards and quality gates
3. **Identify and prioritize blockers** with actionable resolution strategies
4. **Provide stakeholder-ready reporting** tailored to audience needs and technical context

## Purpose and Context

Quality requirement: All status reports must provide accurate real-time assessment with stakeholder-ready reporting and actionable resolution strategies.

This command is critical because:

- **Workflow Transparency**: Real-time status visibility prevents bottlenecks and enables proactive intervention
- **Quality Assurance**: Continuous validation ensures adherence to project standards and architectural patterns
- **Team Coordination**: Stakeholder-specific reporting facilitates effective communication and decision-making
- **Risk Mitigation**: Early identification of blockers and compliance issues prevents project delays

## Execution Process

Follow these exact steps for comprehensive status assessment:

Execute these operations concurrently for comprehensive status assessment:

### Primary Status Analysis

1. **Analyze current task phase** and calculate accurate completion percentage
2. **Validate documentation compliance** against project workflow requirements
3. **Assess technical integration status** with codebase and development environment
4. **Identify active blockers** across technical, process, and dependency categories

### Quality and Compliance Validation

1. **Verify phase gate completion** using project-specific quality standards
2. **Validate CI/CD integration** and automated quality tool compliance
3. **Check team process alignment** and communication pattern adherence
4. **Evaluate technical debt impact** and architectural consistency

### Stakeholder Communication Preparation

1. **Generate audience-specific reports** for technical, product, and management teams
2. **Prepare remediation guidance** with actionable resolution steps
3. **Calculate timeline adjustments** based on discovered complexity and blockers
4. **Invoke meeting-facilitator sub-agent** for stakeholder communication coordination
