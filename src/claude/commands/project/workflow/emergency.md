Execute emergency workflow override with critical incident response and technical debt management: $ARGUMENTS

## Explicit Instructions

This command accomplishes the following specific objectives:

1. **Validate genuine emergency conditions** ensuring emergency override is justified and appropriate for critical incident response
2. **Execute minimal viable intervention** with the smallest possible change to resolve immediate crisis while preserving system stability
3. **Create comprehensive technical debt tracking** documenting emergency decisions and planning proper workflow completion
4. **Establish post-emergency recovery process** ensuring lessons learned and long-term solution development

## Context and Motivation

This command is reserved for genuine emergencies because:

- **Business Continuity**: Critical incidents require immediate intervention to prevent business impact and system failures
- **Risk Management**: Emergency situations demand rapid response while maintaining system integrity and change control
- **Technical Debt Control**: Emergency interventions create technical debt that must be properly managed and resolved
- **Learning Opportunity**: Emergency responses provide valuable insights for system improvement and incident prevention

## Emergency Qualification Criteria

**CRITICAL CONDITIONS (Emergency Override Justified):**

- Production system complete failure affecting all users
- Active data corruption or loss in progress
- Security breach with ongoing unauthorized access
- Critical business operation completely blocked (revenue impact)
- System instability causing cascading failures

**NON-EMERGENCY CONDITIONS (Use Standard Workflow):**

- Performance degradation without complete failure
- Non-critical feature defects or usability issues
- Planned maintenance or optimization requirements
- Enhancement requests or feature additions
- Historical issues without immediate business impact

## Execution Process

Execute these operations sequentially for emergency response:

### Emergency Validation and Justification

1. **Validate emergency conditions** confirming genuine crisis requiring immediate intervention
2. **Document emergency justification** with business impact assessment and urgency rationale
3. **Assess intervention scope** determining minimal change required to resolve immediate crisis
4. **Identify stakeholder notification requirements** for emergency intervention communication

### Rapid Problem Assessment

1. **Execute 5-minute problem analysis** identifying immediate root cause and system impact
2. **Determine minimal viable fix** with smallest possible change to resolve crisis
3. **Assess change risk** evaluating potential side effects and system stability impact
4. **Plan rollback procedure** preparing immediate recovery if intervention fails

### Emergency Intervention Implementation

1. **Implement surgical fix** with minimal system changes and maximum safety precautions
2. **Validate fix effectiveness** confirming emergency condition resolution
3. **Monitor system stability** ensuring intervention doesn't create additional issues
4. **Document all changes** with detailed rationale and emergency context

### Technical Debt and Recovery Planning

1. **Create technical debt tracking** documenting emergency decisions and proper resolution requirements
2. **Plan comprehensive analysis** scheduling full workflow completion within 48 hours
3. **Establish monitoring protocols** ensuring emergency fix remains stable
4. **Schedule post-emergency review** for lessons learned and system improvement
