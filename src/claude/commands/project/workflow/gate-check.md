Execute comprehensive workflow gate enforcement with phase validation and compliance verification: $ARGUMENTS

## Explicit Instructions

This command accomplishes the following specific objectives:

1. **Validate workflow phase compliance** ensuring each task phase meets quality gates before progression to subsequent phases
2. **Execute comprehensive quality validation** verifying documentation completeness, technical requirements, and stakeholder approvals
3. **Enforce architectural consistency** confirming implementation alignment with approved analysis and planning documentation
4. **Provide actionable remediation guidance** with specific steps for achieving compliance and removing progression blockers

## Context and Motivation

This command is essential for workflow integrity because:

- **Quality Assurance**: Systematic gate enforcement prevents technical debt accumulation and maintains implementation quality
- **Risk Mitigation**: Phase validation catches integration issues and architectural inconsistencies before they compound
- **Team Accountability**: Clear gate criteria ensure consistent standards across all team members and project phases
- **Process Improvement**: Gate violations provide valuable feedback for workflow optimization and team development

## Execution Process

Execute these operations in parallel for comprehensive gate validation:

### Phase-Specific Gate Validation

1. **Analysis Gate Enforcement** validating problem investigation completeness, stakeholder requirement clarity, and technical scope definition
2. **Planning Gate Enforcement** confirming implementation approach approval, architectural decision documentation, and resource estimation accuracy
3. **Implementation Gate Enforcement** verifying code quality standards, integration testing completion, and documentation currency
4. **Deployment Gate Enforcement** ensuring quality validation completion, security compliance, and stakeholder acceptance

### Quality Standards Verification

1. **Documentation compliance assessment** across all required artifacts with completeness and quality validation
2. **Technical standards enforcement** including code quality metrics, testing coverage, and performance requirements
3. **Architectural consistency validation** ensuring implementation alignment with approved design decisions
4. **Stakeholder approval verification** confirming all required approvals and sign-offs are obtained

### Remediation Planning and Guidance

1. **Gap identification and prioritization** with specific remediation steps and completion timelines
2. **Stakeholder coordination** for approval workflows and decision-making processes
3. **Quality improvement recommendations** based on common gate violations and best practices
4. **Process optimization insights** for improving workflow efficiency and compliance
